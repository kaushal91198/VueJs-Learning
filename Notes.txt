Vue.js data:
    Defined as a function that returns an object.
    Each property of the returned object is a reactive state variable.
    Vue.js automatically makes these properties reactive, meaning the view will re-render when these properties change.
    You can directly modify the properties of the data object.
    Vue's data properties are directly mutable, whereas React’s state variables are updated through a setter function returned by useState.The way they are declared and used is different, as shown in the examples above.data in Vue is an option in the component’s configuration object, whereas useState is a hook used inside a functional component in React.
